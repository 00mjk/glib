G_DEFINE_TYPE (GAction, g_action, G_TYPE_OBJECT)

/**
 * SECTION:gaction
 * @title: GAction
 * @short_description: an action
 *
 * #GAction represents a single named action.
 *
 * The main interface to an action is that it can be activated with
 * g_action_activate().  This results in the 'activate' signal being
 * emitted.  An activation has a #GVariant parameter (which may be
 * %NULL).  The correct type for the parameter is determined by a static
 * parameter type (which is given at construction time).
 *
 * An action may optionally have a state, in which case the state may be
 * set with g_action_set_state().  This call takes a #GVariant.  The
 * correct type for the state is determined by a static state type
 * (which is given at construction time).
 *
 * The state may have a hint associated with it, specifying its valid
 * range.
 *
 * #GAction is intended to be used both as a simple action class and as
 * a base class for more complicated action types.  The base class
 * itself supports activation and state.  Not supported are state hints
 * and filtering requests to set the state based on the requested value.
 * You should subclass if you require either of these abilities.
 *
 * In all cases, the base class is responsible for storing the name of
 * the action, the parameter type, the enabled state, the optional state
 * type and the state and emitting the appropriate signals when these
 * change.  The base class is also responsbile for filtering calls to
 * g_action_activate() and g_action_set_state() for type safety and for
 * the state being enabled.
 *
 * Probably the only useful thing to do with a #GAction is to put it
 * inside of a #GSimpleActionGroup.
